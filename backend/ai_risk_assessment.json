      "description": "The document identifies 6 major unresolved topics including freight routing logic, B2B cartonization scenarios, inventory messaging to SAP, trading partner SKU conversion, and UPC conflicts between B2B and B2C SKUs. These gaps could require significant additional development work.",
      "potential_impact": "Unresolved gaps could lead to scope creep, project delays, additional costs, and functionality that doesn't meet business requirements. Critical business processes may not work as expected, requiring post-implementation fixes.",
